DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGE

Build a working commerce implementation. Implement a product, organise products in categories/collections, build a checkout flow (minus payment of course. No phi$hing guys!) We have no special products in mind. Find some fun examples online: T-shirts, hoodies, or maybe a bow tie

The choice of solution, platform and technology is open. We donâ€™t judge based on specific frameworks or languages. This gives you freedom to solve the challenge as website, a smartphone app or something crazy for your TV. Go ahead code something awesome. :)

The development challenge does not require any design or user interface design skills. In this challenge we are evaluating your coding skills, not your design skills. We recommend that you use a free template or copy-paste your layout/UI from somewhere nice. A good sense of aesthetics is however always appreciated. 

Your solution should contain

Demo and code:
Submit a link to your project and source.
Optional extras
If you run out of ideas but have time, consider these:
Store user profiles somewhere. Add product filters on categories. Implement single sign on using Facebook or other SoMe. Build a nice search-as-you-type feature.
By the way: It is ok to submit a half finished project. It is a whole lot better to submit something half finished than submitting nothing. Last year the 2nd place was a half finished projects.
