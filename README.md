# ABOUT STUDENT GEEK CHALLENGE

We love to see the talents of the next generation of internet professionals do amazing stuff. At Novicell we are geeks! We think it is cool to be able to build software that can handle thousands of visitors - at the same time. Therefore, the last three years, we have organized Geek Challenge (develop) where we challenge student to show us how nerdy it can be!

# THIS YEAR ...

Usually we just invite young devs to the challenge, but this year we've expanded with a design challenge aswell. The lines of the two worlds are more blurry than ever before and we feel it's only fair to see some broader executions. If you're a developer who knows a design (and vice versa) feel free to collaborate on the challenge - you just need to submit your own part.


# DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGE

Build a working commerce implementation. Implement a product, organise products in categories/collections, build a checkout flow (minus payment of course. No phi$hing guys!) We have no special products in mind. Find some fun examples online: T-shirts, hoodies, or maybe a bow tie

The choice of solution, platform and technology is open. We donâ€™t judge based on specific frameworks or languages. This gives you freedom to solve the challenge as website, a smartphone app or something crazy for your TV. Go ahead code something awesome. :)

The development challenge does not require any design or user interface design skills. In this challenge we are evaluating your coding skills, not your design skills. We recommend that you use a free template or copy-paste your layout/UI from somewhere nice. A good sense of aesthetics is however always appreciated. 

# Your solution should contain
* Demo and code:
* Submit a link to your project and source.
* Optional extras
If you run out of ideas but have time, consider these:
* Store user profiles somewhere. 
* Add product filters on categories. 
* Implement single sign on using Facebook or other SoMe. 
* Build a nice search-as-you-type feature.
